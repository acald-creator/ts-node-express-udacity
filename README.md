> Cloud Developer Nanodegree - Course 2 - Udacity Basic Server project

This is a newer project from the Cloud Developer projects. Ever since I worked on the Cloud Developer nanodegree but I never finished, I kept trying to find ways to improve the code and I wanted to transition more from Javascript code to Typescript and use different framework.

Here is the original project this is based on: https://github.com/acald-creator/cloud-developer/tree/master/course-02/exercises/udacity-c2-basic-server
